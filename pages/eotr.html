        <h1 style="padding-left:35%;">The Envy of the Roses</h1>
        <h4 style="padding-left:25%;"> 
            
        Her eyes are closed so softly, <br>
        As snow falls uninhibited, <br>
        Covering her torso with all of their heavenly flakes,<br>
        Gently kissing her cold face,<br>
        Tucking her in a blanket of pristine white,<br>
        As if they owe her their very existence, <br>
        <br>
        Akin to the crescent moon finally waxing, <br>
        Glimmers of its iridescent moonlight passing, <br>
        Past branches of trees, <br>
        And the leaves precariously hanging,<br>
        Past the highest mountains, <br>
        And deepest valleys, <br>
        Just to shine on her ever-radiant face, <br>
        <br>
        And enamored are the roses too, <br>
        That lay loyally by her side, <br>
        Envying her unmitigated beauty,<br>
        As they bloom six feet under, <br>
        Accompanying her forevermore. <br>
