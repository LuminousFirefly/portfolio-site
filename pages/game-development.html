                    <p>Embarking on my own solo game development project with Unreal Engine, I aimed to create a compelling narrative, which serves as the driving force for the game - complementing the gameplay and the world of The Dagger of Life. The ending portrays the blurred lines between good and evil, and how everyone - no matter how dastardly their acts are- believes that they are justified. And not every story has a happy ending...</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Isaac (controlled by the player) is instructed by his leader, Agartha, to retrieve the Crimson dagger which could save the world from complete obliteration.</li>
                        <li>Isaac has to vanquish myriad enemies on his quest - including gigantic spiders, enemy soldiers, and trolls.</li>
                        <li>Agartha leads Isaac to believe that by acquiring the dagger he will become the hero who gives joy and peace to a desolate world.</li>
                        <li>However, a twist towards the end reveals that Agartha wished to use the dagger to destroy the world and thus "cleanse it" of pain and suffering. The "Dagger of Life" became the "Dagger of Death".</li>
                        <li>Upon finding out Agartha's true intentions, Isaac tries to stop Agartha from going through with her vile plan, but he is no match for her magical powers and succumbs to his death.</li>
                        <li>Isaac, who thought he was the saviour of the world, unintentionally brought about its doom.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>I collaborated with a team of experienced developers and artists to create a third-person battle-royale mobile game called Anarchy.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I worked with Unreal Engine 5, using C++ along with UE5's Blueprint scripting system</li>
                        <li>I Implemented gameplay mechanics and functionality such as object trajectories, raycasting, and other advanced character movement and animation components</li>
                        <li>I incorporated UI elements to facilitate the player experience, such as different game and menu screens, sprint locking, and interpolated camera movements for a cinematic effect</li>
                        <li>I experimented with landscape sculpting, height maps, and procedural generation to create a sprawling open world</li>
                        <li>I also worked with version control via git, and carried out comprehensive code documentation.</li>
                    </ul>
