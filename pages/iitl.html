                        <h4>
                            It was a bellowing cry that I heard, <br>
                            One that reeked of desperation. <br>
                            But how could I ignore such a gut-wrenching cry? <br>
                            So I followed it through the crowds. <br>
                            <br>
                            Hordes of commoners passed by, <br>
                            Shuffling through the huge metropolitan streets. <br>
                            But none of them seemed to hear that cry, <br>
                            Their eyes full of apathy that I utterly despised. <br>
                            <br>
                            I caught a glimpse of a child, <br>
                            The source of all that noise. <br>
                            His eyes were swollen and drained, <br>
                            They spoke of an everlasting pain.<br>
                            <br>
                            I approached him cautiously, <br>
                            Trying not to make matters worse. <br>
                            But as I got closer and closer, <br>
                            The pain did not seem to cease. <br>
                            <br>
                            His features were oddly familiar, <br>
                            Reminiscent of who I once was, <br>
                            With ashen hair and blue eyes, <br>
                            And a broken watch from my childhood days. <br>
                            <br>
                            “Are you okay, love?”, I asked softly, <br>
                            But my words fell on deaf ears. <br>
                            As if I don’t exist, <br>
                            As if I never did. <br>
                            
                            I raised my voice thinking perhaps he couldn’t hear, <br>
                            But his cries grow louder too. <br>
                            Perhaps, I was invisible to him <br>
                            The same way he was to them. <br>
                            <br>
                            “Why?”, his voice broke, <br>
                            “Why can all of you not see me?”,<br>
                            He craved mere crumbs, nothing more <br>
                            But even they seemed out of reach. <br>
                            <br>
                            I touched his head gently, <br>
                            Caressing every unloved strand of hair<br>
                            Embracing him strongly and deeply,<br>
                            Hoping that I haven’t come too late, <br>
                            Praying to all the gods I never believed in, <br>
                            That it will be okay. <br>
                            That he will be okay.<br>
                            <br>
                            That I will be okay. <br>
                            <br>
