        <h4 style="padding-left:25%;"> 
            It was a bellowing cry that I heard, <br>
            One that reeked of desperation. <br>
            But how could I ignore such a gut-wrenching cry? <br>
            So I followed it through the crowds. <br>
            <br>
            Hordes of commoners passed by, <br>
            Shuffling through the huge metropolitan streets. <br>
            But none of them seemed to hear that cry, <br>
            Their eyes full of apathy that I utterly despised. <br>
            <br>
            I caught a glimpse of a child, <br>
            The source of all that noise. <br>
            His eyes were swollen and drained, <br>
            They spoke of an everlasting pain.<br>
            <br>
            I approached him cautiously, <br>
            Trying not to make matters worse. <br>
            But as I got closer and closer, <br>
            The pain did not seem to cease. <br>
            <br>
            His features were oddly familiar, <br>
            Reminiscent of who I once was, <br>
            With ashen hair and blue eyes, <br>
            And a broken watch from my childhood days. <br>
            <br>
            “Are you okay, love?”, I asked softly, <br>
            But my words fell on deaf ears. <br>
            As if I don’t exist, <br>
            As if I never did. <br>
            
            I raised my voice thinking perhaps he couldn’t hear, <br>
            But his cries grow louder too. <br>
            Perhaps, I was invisible to him <br>
            The same way he was to them. <br>
            <br>
            “Why?”, his voice broke, <br>
            “Why can all of you not see me?”,<br>
            He craved mere crumbs, nothing more <br>
            But even they seemed out of reach. <br>
            <br>
            I touched his head gently, <br>
            Caressing every unloved strand of hair<br>
            Embracing him strongly and deeply,<br>
            Hoping that I haven’t come too late, <br>
            Praying to all the gods I never believed in, <br>
            That it will be okay. <br>
            That he will be okay.<br>
            <br>
            That I will be okay. <br>
