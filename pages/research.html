        <h2>Structure Learning for Bayesian Networks</h2>
        <i><h3>Fall 2024</h3></i>
        <p> A Machine Learning research paper which explored and compared different methods and algorithms to learn the structure of Bayesian Networks. It consists of the following sections, </p>
            <ul> 
                <li> Discussion of the 3 broad categories of algorithms: constraint-based, score-based, and hybrid, including their mathematical significance and examples/simulations.</li>
                <li> An evaluation of the optimality of the algorithms in terms of space and time complexity </li>
                <li> Applying each algorithm to a music recommender system to observe and compare results on real-world data. </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>The Impact of Political Symbols on Electoral Success in Turkey</h2>
        <i><h3>Fall 2024 - Spring 2025</h3></i>
        <p> I collaborated with a professor and fellow students to contribute towards a research paper on political propaganda in Turkey, contributing to the technical development of large-scale image collection, preprocessing, and computer vision analysis. </p>
            <ul> 
                <li>I helped build a Google Maps API–based pipeline to collect and geocode approximately 750,000 panoramas from Istanbul for political propaganda analysis. </li>
                <li>I assisted in the preprocessing and annotation of nearly 7000 images while exploring equirectangular undistortion, different sampling techniques, and duplicate filtering.</li>
                <li>I trained YOLOv8 models in Roboflow to detect party and national flags, and evaluated depth estimation models for symbol surface area analysis. </li>
                <li>I created district-level geospatial visualizations in Python, mapping propaganda density across Istanbul.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Metric Spaces: The Mathematics of Distance and Similarity</h2>
        <i><h3>April 2025 - May 2025</h3></i>
       <p>
An intuitive exposition of metric spaces designed for a general audience, introducing the formal definition of a distance function and its core properties. Explores real-world and computer science applications (such as recommendation systems, search heuristics, and edit distance) to illustrate how these abstract mathematical structures are all around us.
